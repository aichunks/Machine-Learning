## Linear Regression

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response or dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables or independent variables.

In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of the response given the values of the explanatory variables or predictors is assumed to be an affine function of those values; less commonly, the conditional median or some other quantile is used. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors, rather than on the joint probability distribution of all of these variables, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.

## Getting Started 
This is a Basic Machine learning Algorithm Linear Regression built from scratch.With this you can understand how Linear work actually works. You can see the estimation from the data which model does to predict values.
