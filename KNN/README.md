# Machine Learning
## k-nearest-neighbor

In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression

k-NN is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification. The k-NN algorithm is among the simplest of all machine learning algorithms.

Knn has different distance calculation approaches such as euclidean,manhattan,minkowski and hamming distance
Knn has different algorithms bruteforce,KDD tree and ball tree.
**HERE IS AN EXAMPLE HOW KNN WORKS**
