## DECISION TREE

A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility.

Decision trees are commonly used in operations research, specifically in decision analysis, to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a goal, but are also a popular tool in machine learning.

## Getting Started

This is a Basic Machine learning Algorithm Decision Tree  built from scratch.With this you can understand how decision tree actually works. This decision tree splits the data using **Ginni Index** Soon We will be uploading Splitting based on Information Gain or Entropy.
