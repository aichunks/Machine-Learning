## Neural Network

A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence problems. 

The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred as a linear combination.

## Getting Started 

This is a Basic Neural Network implemented from scratch only using numpy and matplotlib for plotting the curves and decision boundary.In the Jupyter file many layers, activation functions have also been shown which are implemented from scratch to.

## Prerequisites

PYTHON
SKLEARN
PANDAS
NUMPY

```
pip install scikit-learn   (for accuracy calculation and stuff)
PIP INSTALL PANDAS
PIP INSTALL NUMPY
```

## Deployment

**Clone the Repo and then Just install the Prerequisites and you are good to go**
