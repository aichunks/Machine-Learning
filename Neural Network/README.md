## Neural Network

A neural network is a network or circuit of neurons, or in a modern sense, an artificial neural network, composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence problems. 

The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred as a linear combination.

**HERE IS AN EXAMPLE HOW NEURAL NETWORK LEARNS**

## Getting Started 

This is a Basic Machine learning Algorithm Decision Tree  built from scratch.With this you can understand how decision tree actually works. This decision tree splits the data using **Ginni Index** Soon We will be uploading Splitting based on Information Gain or Entropy.
